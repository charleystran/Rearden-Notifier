Rearden Notifier can be used in 2 ways

Without Running your own Rearden Instance.

If you are looking for a free basic error tracking app, but do not want to run
your own rearden instance, the you can sign up for new account at rearden.herokuapp.com. After you sign up. Do the following.

In your application
    gem 'rearden_notifier'
Then
    rails g rearden_notifier:install

The generator installs configuration file in config/initializers
